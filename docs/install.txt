How to install Billboard
=========================

The easy way : Tools module
---------------------------
Billboard can be installed using QM-B's excellent 'Tools' module (http://addons.impresscms.org/modules/wfdownloads/singlefile.php?cid=248&lid=1460).

The not-so-easy way : manual
----------------------------
Billboard is installed as a regular ImpressCMS module, which means you should copy the complete /billboard folder into the /modules directory of your website.
Then, log in to your site as administrator, go to System Admin > Modules, look for the Billboard icon in the list of uninstalled modules and click in the install icon.
Follow the directions in the screen and you'll be ready to go.
